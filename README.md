# Improved AEROBLADE for Detection of Post-Processed Images | [Project Page](https://anisundar18.github.io/aeroblade_mod/)


## Overview
The main objective of this project is to improve the robustness of [AEROBLADE](https://github.com/jonasricker/aeroblade) to post-processing via training. A detailed accound can be found in the Project Page linked about.

## Setup
The instructions to setup the environment can be found [here](https://github.com/jonasricker/aeroblade). We also use the data provided by the original paper as our training data.

## Reproducing our Experiments
For reproducing the original AEROBLADE experiments, please refer to the original codebase. To train a reconstruction based fake image detector please refer to the `train.sh` script which has instructions along with an example. In order to evaluate the model on a test dataset, please refer to the `test.sh`.
